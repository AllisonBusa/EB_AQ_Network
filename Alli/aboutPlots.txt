WindRose: 

- color: wind speed bin 
- paddle size: also wind speed 
- direction: direction where the wind comes from 
- percentage - is percentage of the time that the wind is going in that direction? does it add to 100 %? 
okay so its time going in that direction at that wind speed. 

again, the bigger wind speed is more dominant. what happens when small winds are more dominant than large winds??

-this function also calculates percentage of time when the windspeed is 0, the calm

PercentileRose: 

- calculates percentile levels of a pollutant and plots them by wind direction
what does it mean by percentile levels? like also bins based on value of bin0 magnitude, right? 

It is most useful for showing the
distribution of concentrations by wind direction and often can reveal different sources
e.g. those that only affect high percentile concentrations such as a chimney stack.

-concentric circles : wind speed 
-direction: direction where the wind comes from 
-color : the bin associated with a certain windspeed and direction, where the bin is a subsection of the data, divided by percentile 




Hexbin method 
from openair: "The benefit of hexagonal binning is that it
works equally well with enormous data sets e.g. several million records."
